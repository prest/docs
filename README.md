### Introduction

pRESTd is a project that joins the powers of PostgreSQL and REST APIs by creating an innovative platform that simplifies the development and deployment of new APIs using low code. It transforms HTTP RESTful requests into PostgreSQL queries, empowering developers to speed up development, reduce manual coding, and enhance data accessibility. With robust security features, scalability, and seamless integration, pREST API helps businesses unlock the full potential of their data, driving efficiency and growth.

#### How pREST Can Help

* **Low time to market:** to deploy a pREST service, all you need is a modelled database, and it will provide you with a RESTful API to that database;&#x20;
* **Leverages low-code tech**: you don't need to code if you don't want to, but if you need custom SQL queries, it is easy to create and connect to;
* **Simplified Database Operations**: Perform everyday database queries from an HTTP request, reducing the complexity of SQL interactions.
* **Efficient Data Management**: Streamline data handling processes, making it more convenient for developers and organizations to manage their information.
* **Enhanced Security**: Leverage built-in security features to ensure your database operations are robust and secure.
* **Scalability**: Designed to scale with your needs, pRESTd can adapt to the requirements of varying-size projects.
* **Open Source and Community-Driven**: Benefit from the collaborative efforts of a vibrant open-source community. Contribute, report issues, and participate in shaping the project's future.
